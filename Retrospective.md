* The Project helped me understand React 
* Had enough time to touch base the previuos lessons
* Broke the barrier for shyness in communicating with team members
* Reviewed and also had clear picture of Github by using it with team
* when the presentstion was given by each group,I was able to realize that each project needs maximum output in all componenets, because all groups where trying to do the best.



# Areas of Improvement 

* More communication from the day1 
* Could have made a markdown for team as well as individually.
* i could have done my CSS part better.
